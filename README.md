# Module_02_UML

## Introduction

This project introduces the basics of the Unified Modeling Language (UML), which is essential for software design. UML provides a standardized way to visually represent the components and relationships within a system, helping to create maintainable and understandable software architectures.

## Why is UML relevant?

In the early stages of software development, there were no established rules for organizing code, leading to systems that were difficult to manage and maintain. UML was developed to address this issue, offering a common graphical language to depict software architecture. It simplifies communication among developers, enabling the visualization of systems through diagrams, which makes it easier to understand and improve software design.

## Legend of UML Diagrams and its symbols

- **Class**: Represents a class in the system, including its attributes and methods. It is depicted as a rectangle with three compartments: the top compartment contains the class name, the middle compartment lists the attributes, and the bottom compartment shows the methods.

- **Association**: Represents a relationship between classes, indicating that one class is connected to another. It is depicted as a line connecting the classes, with an arrow indicating the direction of the relationship.

- **Aggregation**: Represents a "whole-part" relationship between classes, where one class is composed of other classes. It is depicted as a line with a diamond shape at the "whole" end, indicating that the "whole" class contains the "part" class.

- **Composition**: Represents a stronger form of aggregation, where the "part" class is dependent on the "whole" class. It is depicted as a line with a filled diamond shape at the "whole" end, indicating that the "part" class cannot exist without the "whole" class.

- **Inheritance**: Represents an "is-a" relationship between classes, where one class inherits attributes and methods from another class. It is depicted as a line with a hollow triangle pointing to the superclass.

## How to Run

The project involves the creation of UML diagrams rather than running code. The goal is to produce a class diagram representing the structure of a specific system based on the requirements provided. The diagram should be saved as a `.png` file and submitted for evaluation.

1. Just go to folder `ex00` and open the file `subject.png` to see the UML diagram.

## Exercises

### Exercise 00: Car Composition

- **Synopsis**: 
    In this exercise, a UML class diagram was created to represent the composition of a car. The diagram models several components, including objects such as the `Motor`, `Transmission`, `Wheel`, `Brake`, and others. Various relationships, including inheritance, composition, and aggregation, are represented with the appropriate UML arrows.

- **Relevance**: 
    The exercise demonstrates how to break down a complex system into its constituent parts using UML. By visualizing the structure and interactions of the components within the car, the diagram makes it easier to understand and communicate the system's architecture, which is critical in software engineering.

## Conclusion

This project provides foundational experience in creating UML class diagrams, offering insight into how to model and represent the structure of systems. The skills developed through this exercise are applicable to the design of both simple and complex software architectures, improving the ability to convey and refine system designs.
